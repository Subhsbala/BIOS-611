#HEALTHCARE CLAIMS DATASET

Set your working directory to work to run the make file.
To look at the figures for Project Skeleton HW run:
1. make figures/total_cost_IP.png
2. make figures/total_cost_perdisc_IP.png
3. make figures/Top10_APC.png

To look at the figures for PCA/Clustering HW run:
1. make figures/cluster_plot.png
2. make figures/PCA.png

Note: For this HW, I was told that performing clustering on a small dataset won't result in much by the Professor, but I still attempted to try it out. But as you will see, there are no clusters to be identified.
